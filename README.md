# JutsyVel - Test blog site with Google Authentication

I decided to study about Laravel Framework (as we have a potential project that requires Laravel). Hence, here is my output. 

I followed the tutorial found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU7PRmCpx-0&t=3s - fine details as I'm able to catch up properly.

I tweaked some of the files from the tutorial based on my liking. You can fork / clone this repo as you like.
