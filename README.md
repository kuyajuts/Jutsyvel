# Jutsyvel - a test project (exploration) using Laravel 5.6

Hi! This is a repository of my test project in relation to my exploration about Laravel 5. I followed the tutorials by Laravel from Scratch on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU7PRmCpx-0&list=PLillGF-RfqbYhQsN5WMXy6VsDMKGadrJ-) 

The repo contains:
* Parts 1-8 of the said tutorial above;
* It is custom-built to a mini-blog site, stripped down 'About' and 'Services' page.
* Laravel Collective - HTML Form Helpers
* CKEditor

#Kindly update the .env file to your liking. 

> I'll update this repo by next week. I'm going to add authentications, etc. Feel free to fork if you like :)
